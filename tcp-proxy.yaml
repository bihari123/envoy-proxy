# envoy as L4 proxy ( tcp router )
# just remember, tcp proxy by default doesn't do load balancing. It is sticky in nature which means that your browser will keep hitting the same host over and over again.
# in order to make it do load balancing, you need to run the envoy as a single threaded app( not the best idea, but that's what i know as of now)  by the following command
#  $ envoy -c config.yaml --concurrency 1
